# Career Journal Template

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way!
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout each module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time.
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing each module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation.

### Directions
1. Copy the following prompts into your own private gist=. Note: when creating a gist, please make sure to add .md at the end of the title to turn it into markdown format.
2. Respond to the Mod 0 prompts.
3. Submit the link to your document in [this survey](https://forms.gle/x4DCbZV64Z1ouyrY6) for the career development component of your Mod 1 Prework.

### Mod 0
1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?
  * When working towards a goal, I've found myself doing as much research as I can to familiarize myself with the task at hand. The better informed I am, the better choices and decisions I can make. I hope to apply that same methodology while at Turing.

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?
  * I believe one of my strengths is persistence. If I don't understand something, I try to move forward and look for different avenues that allow me to achieve a suitable level of understanding of what I'm trying to learn.

3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):
  * I work best in a closed off environment. There can't be any outside, distracting noise. I can listen to my own music and work at my own pace.

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?
  * My biggest area of improvement would have to be setting respectable expectations on myself. There are times when I expect too much of myself and not meeting those expectations can lead to disappointment and a lack of motivation.

5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
  * Being able to identify and accept weakness is a huge part of growth. One just can't allow them to hinder your progress. Accept them and continue to build upon the strengths.

6. Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:
  * I know I'm going to face a lot of difficult challenges. It'll frustrate me to no end, but I'll work on trusting my team, my cohort, my instructors, and mentor to provide me with the guidance I need to succeed.
